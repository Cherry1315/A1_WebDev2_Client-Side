University assignment.  
Long time since I studied Web Development I. Hence, the project was a crash course trying to relearn new and old concepts.  
I earned a passing grade of 64.6%. With more time, Iâ€™m confident I could have achieved a higher grade (espcially since I got a High Disction in the next assignment: Server-side ).
